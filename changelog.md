Changelog
=========

* 1.0.5 (2015-06-29)

	* Fixes an inconsistent scenario in which the plugin created object map rows with a WordPress or Salesforce ID of 0 and then failed to sync new objects because of the database key. Here's how:
		- Change the wordpress_id field on the map table to be a varchar instead of an integer (updating the plugin from the wordpress repo will automatically update this, but users who update manually will need to do it manually)
		- when creating an object map between two items, plugin creates a temporary id value for whichever system does not have the item (ie a temporary wordpress id if we're on a salesforce pull action). This replaces the value of 0 that the plugin previously used before updating the database with the correct id value.
		- This way if the api fails, server goes down, whatever, that tmp id is unique down to the milisecond. The database key can stay, making sure duplicate ids do not get mapped and such, but in a worst case scenario there are rows that keep the temp id because the operation failed. They can be tracked down to when they happened and whether it was a push or pull that failed, by looking up that ID in the database.
	* Also updates documentation to be more clear about how the plugin works with data that exists prior to installation (mostly it doesn't, with some tiny manual exceptions).
