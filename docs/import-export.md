# Import & Export

Some of the data used by this plugin - namely, Fieldmaps, Object Maps, and Plugin Settings - can be imported (from a .json file) and exported (to a .json file).

While this feature is mostly intended for developers at this time, non-developers will possibly find it useful, for example to back up plugin data.
