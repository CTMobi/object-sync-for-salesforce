# Pull from Salesforce to WordPress

When a Salesforce object type that is already mapped to a WordPress object type has an event that is an active trigger occur, a pull occurs. An active trigger is an event (create, update, delete) that happens, in the case of pull, in Salesforce, and is selected in the specific fieldmap's settings. A mapped WordPress object then needs to be created, updated, or deleted to the correct data.
